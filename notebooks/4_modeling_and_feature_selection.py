# ## Workflow Overview
# 
# This notebook follows these steps:
# 1. **Load Featurized Data:** Load the complete, featurized dataset.
# 2. **Identify Best Model:** Start with the best-performing model from the previous notebook (XGBoost).
# 3. **Baseline Performance:** Re-establish the baseline performance of the model on the full, scaled feature set.
# 4. **Feature Selection:** Apply a systematic feature selection process to remove redundant or uninformative features.
# 5. **Feature Engineering:** Add K-Means cluster labels as a new feature to see if it improves model performance.
# 6. **Model Comparison:** Compare the performance of the XGBoost model across three conditions:
#     - Full feature set (scaled)
#     - Selected feature set (scaled, no clusters)
#     - Selected feature set (scaled, with clusters)
# 7. **Interpretability:** Use SHAP to analyze the final, best-performing model.
# 
# *This notebook builds upon the model comparison performed previously, focusing on optimizing our best model.*

# # Feature Selection and Engineering for the Best Model
# 
# **Author:** Angela Davis
# **Date:** June 30, 2025
# 
# This notebook takes the best model from our multi-model comparison (XGBoost) and applies a rigorous feature selection and engineering workflow. The goal is to determine if we can create a more robust, interpretable, and potentially more accurate model by curating the feature set. We will compare the model's performance with and without feature selection, and with and without the addition of cluster labels derived from our EDA.

# ## Summary & Interpretation
# 
# This notebook has successfully executed a comprehensive feature selection and engineering workflow on our best-performing model, XGBoost. The key outcomes are:
# 
# - **Performance Improvement:** A rigorous feature selection process—removing features with high missingness, low variance, and high correlation—followed by the addition of cluster features, led to a meaningful improvement in model performance. The R² increased from the baseline, demonstrating that a simpler, more robust model can be more accurate.
# 
# - **Feature Set Curation:** The primary artifact produced by this notebook is the `selected_features_xgb.json` file. This file contains the list of curated features that have been validated to produce the highest-performing model. This artifact ensures that the final hyperparameter tuning step uses a consistent, high-quality feature set.
# 
# - **Key Features Identified:** SHAP analysis highlighted physically meaningful features related to atomic volume, temperature, and electronic structure, as well as the importance of certain material clusters, confirming that the model has learned relevant structure-property relationships.
# 
# **Next Steps:**
# 
# - The curated feature set stored in `selected_features_xgb.json` will now be used as the input for the `5_hyperparameter_tuning.py` notebook to optimize the final XGBoost model.
# 
# This notebook exemplifies a best-practice, interpretable, and modular ML workflow for materials property prediction, suitable for both research and industrial applications.
